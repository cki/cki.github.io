	  <h1>Tankers are still undervalued</h1>
	  <h5>Disclaimer</h5>
	  <p>
	    I am a retail investor. Fintwit would probably call me a tanker tourist. Do not take anything I write as investment advise. Caveat emptor.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Thesis</h2>
	  <p>
	    I started to invest in Tankers in late 2019. While the thesis has not changed since then, it got boosted.<br />
	    The initial thesis was: The crude and product tankers market has gotten constraint. <u>Supply and demand is shifting.</u>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In late 2019 IMO2020 was on the horizon forcing all tankers to use low sulfur oil or invest in scrubbers for the year 2020.<br />
	    This alone made operating older vessels less profitable. IMO2030 with yet unknown looming conditions is constraining the tanker order books for newbuilds.<br/>
	    Who is going to buy a vessel that gets written off in 20 years if they don't know what specs the vessel should have? 
	    With an aging fleet, supply and demand is going to shift in favor of suppliers.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <u>COVID-19 added a boost to the thesis.</u>The increasing contango in the oil market is taking up vessels for storage deals, decreasing the supply of tankers even further and putting a bottom under tanker rates.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Since earnings season is coming up. I wanted to take the time and check in on my investments. In the following I will estimate what the companies have earned already and guestimate the outlook for the rest of the year.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Counterthesis</h2>
	  <p>
	    <u>Management is not what you wish for.</u> When checking up on corporate management you are reminded of pirates of the old age.<br />
	    If they decide to waste the companies inflow of cash (on newbuilds) the whole thesis could crumble.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    <u>Volatility is high.</u> It seems that some algos have bunched tanker companies with oil companies. This makes for a very rough ride when investing in tankers.<br/>
	    It also gives quite decent entry chances.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    <u>Tanker customers could default.</u> Tanker companies apparently can not take posession of oil legally. They still have to deliver the cargo. <br />
	    They try to diversify their customers but given that their background is not very diverse you have systemic risk in your portfolio.<br />
	    When a customer defaults the tanker might be hostage to the bank
	    bankruptcy management of the customer. Where do they offload their cargo given current storage dynamics?
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <u>The stonks might not move.</u> I honestly do not know why you invest if you do not believe in buying a undervalued company given high earnings.<br />
	    Some companies have dividend "guaranteed" policies so there might be a downside protection.<br />
	    Given time and data I will try and incorporate downside protection into my model and post an update. <br />
	    Earnings season could act as a catalyst (next month).
	  </p>
	  <p>

	  </p>


	  <h2>The dataset</h2>
	  <p>
	    Being the retail investor that I am, I have to take the breadcrumbs that are provided to me by the community. <br />
	    I am especially thankful for the data provided by <a href="https://twitter.com/JHannisdahl">@JHannisdahl</a> containing daily TCE Spot rates.<br />
	    This piece is my way of saying thanks to the community that gave me the idea, the confidence to trade it and data to write this piece. <br />
	    I want to especially thank: <a href="https://twitter.com/hkuppy">@hkuppy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/calvinfroedge">calvinfroedge</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JimmyWar77">@JimmyWar77</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/the5hippingman">@the5hippingman</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Having no access to freight forward agreements or any other proprietary data,  I had to collect TCE spot rates from twitter.
	    Whenever I had a written update for a given vessel class I took the given rate from the current date till the next update.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    My estimation can only be as good as my dataset. In late 2019 I already tried and asked for datasets - no luck.<br/>
	    <u>I'd be happy to take your dataset and update my numbers</u>. <br />
	    I have a background in data processing - I'll take any data you have and clean it up if it looks useful.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <u>More accurate projections might be possible:</u> One tanker pool operator selectively publishes numbers for their VLCC.
	    This would give a more accurate forecast for companies having spot exposure to VLCC. <br />
	    It could also give insight into geographic exposure of companies given that trips to China seem to be extremely sought after.<br />
	    For example: DHT's next earnings could probably be forecasted with a high degree of confidence.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Are tanker companies still cheap?</h3>
	  <p>
	    In the following I take the number of vessels a company has in a given vessel type. For every given vesseltype I take aboves rates and multiply by the number of days since the start of the year.
	    To take matters into perspective I divide the endproduct by the Marketcap.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <u>This methodology has flaws!</u> <br/>
	    Not all vessels of a given company have spot exposure.<br />
	    I do not have TCE for all vesseltypes. If a vessel falls into a category for which I do not have data, it earns nothing.<br />
	    Some vessels are bunched together on companywebsites.<br />
	    Product tankers could take crude. I have no source on in which market a tanker operates.	    <br />

	    For some of those flaws I tried to add a note.

	  <p>
	    So are they still cheap? I'd say yes but given aboves table and a companies balancesheet I guess you can decide for yourself how much you want to downgrade the TCE and measure up against a companies liabilities.
