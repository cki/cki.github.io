	  <h1>A case for why tankers might still be undervalued</h1>
	  <i>2020-04-24</i><br /><br />

	  <p>
	    <u>Disclaimer: I am not a professional investor. I am a retail investor. Fintwit would probably call me a tanker tourist. Do not take anything I write as investment advise. Do not trust my numbers. Caveat emptor.</u>
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Earnings season is coming up. I wanted to take the time and check in on my investments. In the following I will present one tanker thesis and one lazy model of how to evaluate tankers. We will sum average Spot TCE and divide by Market cap. 
	  </p>

	  <h2>Thesis</h2>
	  <p>
	    I started to invest in Tankers in late 2019. While the thesis has not changed since then, it got boosted.<br />
	    The initial thesis was: The crude and product tankers market has gotten constraint. <u>Supply and demand is shifting.</u>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In late 2019 IMO2020 was on the horizon forcing all tankers to use low sulfur oil or invest in scrubbers in 2020.<br />
	    IMO2030 with yet unknown looming conditions is constraining the tanker order books for newbuilds.<br/>
	    Who is going to buy a vessel that gets written off in 20 years if they don't know what specs the vessel should have? 
	    With an aging fleet supply and demand is going to shift in favor of suppliers.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <u>COVID-19 added a boost to the thesis.</u>The increasing contango in the oil market is taking up vessels for storage deals, decreasing the supply of tankers even further and putting a bottom under tanker rates.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Counterthesis</h2>
	  <p>
	    <u>Management is not what you wish for.</u> When checking up on corporate management you are reminded of pirates of the old age.
	    If they decide to waste the companies inflow of cash (on newbuilds) the whole thesis could crumble.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    <u>Volatility is high.</u> It seems that some algos have bunched tanker companies with oil companies. This makes for a very rough ride when investing in tankers.
	    It however also gives quite decent entry points into a possible position.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    <u>Tanker customers could default.</u> Tanker companies apparently can not take posession of product legally. They still have to deliver the cargo.
	    They try to diversify their customers but given that their background is not diverse you have systemic risk in your portfolio.
	    When a customer defaults the vessel might be hostage to the bankruptcy management of the customer. Where do they offload their cargo given current storage dynamics?
	    Tanker payment seems to be subordinated debt.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <u>The stonks might not move.</u> I honestly do not know why you invest if you do not believe in buying a undervalued company given high earnings.<br />
	    Some companies have dividend "guaranteed" policies so there might be a downside protection.<br />
	  </p>
	  <p>

	  </p>


	  <h2>The dataset</h2>
	  <p>
	    Being the retail investor that I am, I have to take the breadcrumbs that are provided to me by the community. <br />
	    I am especially thankful for the data provided by <a href="https://twitter.com/JHannisdahl">@JHannisdahl</a> containing daily TCE Spot rates.<br />
	    This piece is my way of saying thanks to the community that gave me the idea, the confidence to trade it and data to write this piece. <br />
	    I want to thank: <a href="https://twitter.com/hkuppy">@hkuppy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/calvinfroedge">calvinfroedge</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JimmyWar77">@JimmyWar77</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/the5hippingman">@the5hippingman</a> and the rest of tanker Twitter.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Having no access to freight forward agreements or any other proprietary data,  I had to collect TCE spot rates from twitter.
	    Whenever I had a written update for a given vessel class I took the given rate from the current date till the next update.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    My estimation can only be as good as my dataset. In late 2019 I already tried and asked for datasets - no luck.
	    <u>I'd be happy to take your dataset and update my numbers</u>.
	    I have a background in data processing - I'll take any data you have and clean it up if it looks useful.
	    You can reach me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/CalcEverything">@CalcEverything</a>.
	    Given better data I can come up with better models.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <u>More accurate projections might be possible:</u> One tanker pool operator selectively publishes numbers for their VLCC.
	    This would give a more accurate forecast for companies having VLCC in their fleet.
	    It could also give insight into geographic exposure of companies given that trips to China seem to be extremely sought after.
	    For example: DHT's next earnings could probably be forecasted with a high degree of confidence.
	  </p>


	  <h2>My calculations</h2>
	  <p>
	    <i>
	    MCAP => Marketcap of a given company<br/>
	    Mean - σ => Mean TCE Spot rate for a given vessel type minus one standard deviation<br/>
	    Mean => Mean TCE Spot rate for a given vessel type<br/>
	    Mean + σ => Mean TCE Spot rate for a given vessel type plus one standard deviation<br/>
	    </i>
	  </p>

	  <h3>Estimated TCE by vessel type</h3>
	  <i>Below my estimates of the TCE US$ (in thousands) grouped by tankertype from 2020-01-01 till 2020-04-24</i>
	  <div class="datatablecontainer">
	    <table class="table table-dark table-hover" id="vesselrates">

	      </tbody>

	    </table>
	  </div>
	  
	  <h3>Are tanker companies still cheap?</h3>
	  <p>
	    In the following I take the number of vessels a company has in a given vessel type. For every given vesseltype I take aboves rates and multiply by the number of days since the start of the year.
	    To take matters into perspective I divide the endproduct by the Marketcap. <br />
	    DHT's calculation would look like this: (98.9 * 27 * 114 * 1000)  / 1190000000
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <u>This methodology has many flaws!</u> <br/>
	    Not all vessels of a given company have spot exposure. Keep that in mind.<br />
	    I do not have TCE for all vesseltypes. If a vessel falls into a category for which I do not have data, it earns nothing.<br />
	    Some vessels are bunched together on companywebsites.<br />
	    Product tankers could take crude. I have no source on in which market a tanker operates.<br />
	    For some of those flaws I tried to add a note.<br /><br />

	  <p>
	    Given aboves tables and a companies balancesheet I guess you can decide for yourself: Downgrade the summed TCE / MCAP by what you would be the correct spot exposure for the company. Downgrade some more because of the blody pirates in managment that will take their pound of blood. Open the balancesheet and check the guestimated cash flows against their liabilities.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Please also note that the upside of tanker stocks currently is somewhat tied to the upside of a contango in the oil market. The original thesis however remains: <u>The fleet is aging and that might not change for a while.</u>
	  </p>
	  <br /><br />
	  <h3>How do I plan on playing this</h3>
	  <h4>When to get in?</h4>
	  <p>
	    I am already in. For you, dear reader, earnings season is upon us.
	    This might act as a catalyst for many of the above companies. Still some companies might lag as their rates have a high standard deviation from the mean so its important when they actually fixed their vessels.
	  </p>
	  <h4>When to get out?</h4>
	  <p>
	    When the orderbook for newbuilds fills.
	  </p>
	  <br />
	  <h3>The future</h3>
	  <p>
	    Depending on what kind of data I get I will post an update to this piece.<br />
	    I already have some ideas for DHT because they only have VLCC and their tanker pool operator posts fixes.
